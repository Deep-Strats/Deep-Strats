DeepStrats is a place for my work on Machine Learning and Data Science. 
I believe that using data to improve our decision making is not only possible but also a step to make even better things in the world. 
I consider working on many topics from Sports, Video Games, Science and anything else that might look interesting.
If you want to reach out to me you can send me an email to deepstrategyonline@gmail.com
